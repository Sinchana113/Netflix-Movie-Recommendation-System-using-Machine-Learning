# Netflix-Movie-Recommendation-System-using-Machine-Learning
A content-based recommendation system that suggests movies similar to a given title using text vectorization and cosine similarity

This project implements a movie recommendation system inspired by Netflix.
The system recommends movies based on similarity between movies using machine learning techniques such as text vectorization and cosine similarity.

The goal is to help users discover movies similar to their interests by analyzing movie features like genres, descriptions, and metadata.

# Objective

-Build a recommendation system that suggests similar movies

  Movie title
  Genre
  Description / overview
  Other metadata

# Technologies Used
